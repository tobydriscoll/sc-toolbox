function [wcfix,wc] = crfixwc(w,beta,cr,aff,Q,wc)
%CRFIXWC Fix conformal center in crossratio formulation.
%   The conformal center is defined as the image of zero from the
%   disk. The parameter problem solution obtained from CRPARAM
%   deliberately leaves this unspecified. Before one can compute forward
%   or inverse maps, then, one must first fix the conformal center.
%       
%   WCFIX = CRFIXWC(W,BETA,CR,AFF,Q,WC) returns a vector containing the
%   information that CRMAP and CRINVMAP need in order to place the
%   conformal center at WC. You must first run CRAFFINE to find AFF.
%   
%   If you leave out the argument WC, you will be prompted for it
%   graphically, and it will be the second output argument.  
%       
%   See also CRPARAM, CRAFFINE, CRMAP, CRINVMAP.
