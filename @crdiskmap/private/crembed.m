%CREMBED Embed prevertices for given crossratios.
%   CREMBED(CR,Q,QNUM) embeds prevertices of given crossratios CR and
%   quadrilateral graph information Q (see QLGRAPH). The embedding is
%   constructed so that the prevertices of quadrilateral QNUM are in a
%   rectangle and do not crowd up against each other or any other
%   prevertices (as long as no crossratios are very far from unity). The
%   resulting S-C map should be accurate for that rectangle, inculding
%   the four prevertices of quadrilateral QNUM.
