%SCIMAPZ0 (not intended for calling directly by the user)
%   SCIMAPZ0 returns starting points for computing inverses of
%   Schwarz-Christoffel maps.
%
%   Each wp(j) (in the polygon plane) requires z0(j) (in the fundamental
%   domain) whose image w0(j) is such that the line segment from w0(j)
%   to wp(j) lies in the target (interior or exterior) region.  The
%   algorithm here is to choose z0(j) as a (weighted) average of
%   successive pairs of adjacent prevertices.  The resulting w0(j) is on
%   a polygon side.  Each choice is tested by looking for intersections
%   of the segment with (other) sides of the polygon.
%
%   After randomly trying 10 weights with such prevertex pairs, the
%   routine gives up.  Failures are pretty rare.  Slits are the most
%   likely cause of trouble, since the intersection method doesn't know
%   "which side" of the slit it's on.  In such a case you will have to
%   supply starting points manually, perhaps by a continuation method.
